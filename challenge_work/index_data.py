üó∫Ô∏è Explore: Which index has produced the highest average annual return?
üìä Visualize: Create a plot visualizing a 30 day moving average for an index of your choosing.
üîé Analyze: Compare the volatilities of the indexes included in the dataset.

What is Volatility?
Volatility is a measure of the rate of fluctuations in the price of a security over time. 
It indicates the level of risk associated with the price changes of a security. 
Investors and traders calculate the volatility of a security to assess past variations in the prices 
to predict their future movements.


Scenario:

You are working for an investment firm that is looking to invest in index funds.
They have provided you with a dataset containing the returns of 13 different indexes. 
Your manager has asked you to make short-term forecasts for several of the most promising 
indexes to help them decide which would be a good fund to include. 
Your analysis should also include a discussion of the associated risks and volatility of each fund you focus on.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your 
motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
